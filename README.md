This project aims to develop a Flappy Bird game using Java’s AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries for rendering graphics. The game replicates the simple yet addictive mechanics of the original Flappy Bird, where a bird must navigate through gaps between randomly generated pipes without colliding with them.
The development process starts by creating a game window using JFrame and JPanel, which will act as the canvas for drawing game elements like the bird, pipes, and background. At the heart of the game is a game loop, which continuously updates the game state and re-renders the graphics, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
The main features of the game include:
1.	Game Loop: A continuous loop that updates and redraws the game at regular intervals.
2.	Bird Movement: Implementing mouse or keyboard input to make the bird “flap” and move upwards while gravity pulls it down.
3.	Pipe Generation: Randomly generating pipes and making them scroll from right to left across the screen.
4.	Collision Detection: Implementing logic to detect collisions between the bird and pipes, or between the bird and the ground, to end the game.
5.	Scoring System: Adding a scoring mechanism that increments whenever the bird successfully passes between pipes.
This project will also incorporate basic physics for the bird’s motion, sound effects for a richer gameplay experience, and a simple graphical interface for the player. The final result will be a fully playable version of Flappy Bird with functional game mechanics and a scoring system.
